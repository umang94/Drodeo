# Batch Video Processing Implementation Plan

**Version:** 2.0.0  
**Last Updated:** September 13, 2025  
**Status:** Updated Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation plan for processing unlimited input videos by intelligently concatenating them into a single video file for Gemini processing, while maintaining the ability to reference original video segments for high-quality editing.

## Problem Statement

The current system has a hard limit of 10 videos due to Gemini API constraints. When more than 10 videos are found, the system truncates to the first 10, potentially missing valuable content. This limitation prevents processing large video collections effectively.

## Solution Architecture

### High-Level Flow
```
Original: All videos → Gemini Analysis → Self-Translation → Editing
New:     All videos → Single Concatenation → Single Gemini API Call → Self-Translation → Editing
```

### Key Components

1. **Single Concatenation**: Concatenate ALL input videos into a single temporary video file with blank frames
2. **Blank Frame Injection**: Add 1-2 second blank frames between concatenated videos to ensure Gemini detects scene changes
3. **Video Reference Mapping**: Maintain precise timing metadata to translate Gemini's timestamps back to original video segments
4. **Temporary Storage**: Store concatenated video in `temp/` directory with automatic cleanup
5. **Single API Call**: Process the entire concatenated video in one Gemini API call

## Video Reference Mapping System

### Purpose
To translate Gemini's timestamp recommendations from concatenated videos back to original video segments for accurate editing, enabling a single API call with all content while maintaining editing precision.

### Data Structures
```python
class VideoBatchMapping:
    batches: List[Batch]  # All batches processed

class Batch:
    batch_id: int
    concatenated_path: str
    original_videos: List[VideoSegment]  # Videos in this batch
    total_duration: float

class VideoSegment:
    original_path: str
    start_in_batch: float  # Start time in concatenated video
    end_in_batch: float    # End time in concatenated video
```

### Mapping Process
1. During concatenation, maintain precise timing metadata for each original video
2. When Gemini returns timestamps, use mapping to identify original video and time offset
3. Pass original video references to editing phase for high-quality rendering
4. Handle blank frame durations in timestamp calculations

### Gemini API Limits (Gemini 2.5+)
- **Max videos per request**: 10 individual videos, but unlimited concatenated videos
- **Duration limits**: Up to 6 hours of video content in a single API call when using low resolution
- **Token calculation**: ~100 tokens/sec (low resolution) allows processing up to 6 hours per call
- **Critical**: System already downsamples to low resolution for analysis, enabling single API call processing of tens or hundreds of videos

## Technical Specifications

### Blank Frame Parameters
- **Duration**: 1-2 seconds between concatenated videos
- **Content**: Black screen with no audio
- **Purpose**: Ensure Gemini API detects scene changes between originally separate videos

### Single Concatenation Configuration
- **Maximum Videos**: Unlimited - concatenate ALL videos into a single file
- **Temporary Storage**: `temp/concatenated_videos/` directory
- **File Naming**: `full_concatenated_{timestamp}.mp4`

### Error Handling
- **Failure Mode**: Fail entire process if any batch concatenation fails
- **Cleanup**: Automatic removal of temporary files on both success and failure
- **Validation**: Comprehensive validation of concatenated videos before Gemini analysis

## Implementation Details

### File: `src/core/pipeline.py`

#### New Functions to Add:
1. `_convert_to_low_resolution(video_files: List[str]) -> List[str]`
   - Converts all input videos to low-resolution versions (similar to current input_dev processing)
   - Returns list of paths to low-resolution video files

2. `_concatenate_all_videos(video_files: List[str]) -> Tuple[str, VideoBatchMapping]`
   - Concatenates ALL low-resolution videos into a single temporary video with blank frames
   - Returns path to concatenated video and complete mapping metadata
   - Uses `src/editing/video_editor` utilities

3. `_cleanup_temporary_files(temp_files: List[str])`
   - Removes temporary concatenated videos (keeps low-resolution versions for potential reuse)
   - Called on both success and error conditions

4. `_translate_gemini_timestamps(gemini_reasoning: str, mapping: VideoBatchMapping) -> str`
   - Translates Gemini's timestamps from concatenated video back to original video segments
   - Returns modified reasoning with original video references

#### Modifications to Existing Functions:
1. `_get_development_videos()`
   - Remove the 10-video limit
   - Return all available videos

2. `run_two_step_pipeline()`
   - Add low-resolution conversion and single concatenation logic before calling analyzer
   - Process entire concatenated low-resolution video in one Gemini API call
   - Translate timestamps back to original videos before self-translation
   - Ensure proper cleanup of temporary files

### File: `src/editing/video_editor.py`

#### New Functions to Add:
1. `create_blank_clip(duration: float = 1.0) -> VideoFileClip`
   - Creates a black video clip of specified duration
   - No audio

2. `concatenate_with_blanks(video_paths: List[str], blank_duration: float = 1.0) -> VideoFileClip`
   - Concatenates videos with blank frames between them
   - Returns the concatenated video clip

### File: `src/core/gemini_multimodal_analyzer.py`

#### Potential Modifications:
1. May need to handle analysis of concatenated videos
2. Ensure timestamp mapping maintains accuracy for self-translation

## Data Flow

1. **Input Scanning**: All video files are discovered from input directories
2. **Low-Resolution Conversion**: Convert all input videos to low-resolution versions (similar to current input_dev processing)
3. **Single Concatenation**: ALL low-resolution videos are concatenated into a single temporary video with blank frames
4. **Gemini Analysis**: The entire concatenated low-resolution video is analyzed in a single Gemini API call
5. **Timestamp Translation**: Gemini's timestamps are translated back to original video segments using the mapping system
6. **Self-Translation**: Analysis results are translated into editing instructions referencing original high-quality videos
7. **Video Creation**: Final video is created from original high-quality video files
8. **Cleanup**: Temporary concatenated video is removed (low-resolution versions are kept for potential reuse)

## Performance Considerations

### Processing Overhead
- **Concatenation Time**: Additional time required to pre-concatenate videos (scales with total video duration)
- **Storage**: Temporary storage needed for concatenated video (single file)
- **Memory**: Increased memory usage during concatenation process

### Optimization Strategies
- **Memory Management**: Efficient handling of MoviePy clip objects to prevent leaks
- **Progressive Loading**: Load videos sequentially during concatenation to reduce memory footprint
- **Selective Processing**: Only concatenate when necessary (>10 videos)

## Error Handling Strategy

### Failure Conditions
1. **Concatenation Failure**: If any batch fails to concatenate, fail entire process
2. **Gemini Analysis Failure**: If any batch analysis fails, fail entire process
3. **Storage Issues**: If temporary storage cannot be created, fail gracefully

### Recovery
- **Cleanup**: Always remove temporary files on exit
- **Logging**: Detailed error logging for troubleshooting
- **User Feedback**: Clear error messages indicating the failure point

## Testing Plan

### Unit Tests
1. **Batch Creation**: Verify correct grouping of videos into batches
2. **Concatenation**: Test video concatenation with blank frames
3. **Cleanup**: Verify temporary file removal

### Integration Tests
1. **Full Pipeline**: Test with >10 videos through complete pipeline
2. **Error Conditions**: Test failure scenarios and cleanup
3. **Edge Cases**: Test with exactly 10, 11, 20, etc. videos

### Performance Testing
1. **Timing**: Measure additional processing time for concatenation
2. **Memory**: Monitor memory usage during batch processing
3. **Storage**: Verify temporary storage usage and cleanup

## UI/UX Considerations

### No User Interface Changes
- Command-line interface remains unchanged
- All batch processing happens transparently
- Users continue to use same commands and options

### User Feedback
- Progress indicators for batch processing
- Clear error messages when failures occur
- Logging of batch processing steps
