# Audio-Free Pipeline Implementation Plan

## Objective
Transform Drodeo to remove audio processing from Gemini analysis while:
1. Keeping basic music overlay capability
2. Adding UDIO prompt generation in the multimodal analysis
3. Softly nudging Gemini to prefer longer video durations

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Remove Audio Processing from Gemini
- [x] Modify `gemini_multimodal_analyzer.py` to eliminate audio upload and analysis
- [x] Remove audio-related parameters from multimodal analysis methods
- [x] Update pipeline to handle audio-free operation

### Phase 2: Enhance Multimodal Prompt
- [x] Rewrite multimodal prompt to focus solely on video content analysis
- [x] Add UDIO prompt generation request to the prompt
- [x] Include soft nudge for longer video durations

### Phase 3: Preserve Basic Music Overlay
- [x] Simplify music overlay in `video_editor.py` to basic looping functionality
- [x] Remove complex audio processing (fades, volume adjustments)

### Phase 4: Pipeline Adjustments
- [x] Update `pipeline.py` to make audio optional for analysis
- [x] Modify `run_two_step_pipeline` to handle audio-free analysis
- [ ] Adjust validation to not require music files

## Current Status
Phase 1 completed - Audio processing removed from multimodal analyzer
Phase 2 completed - Enhanced prompt with UDIO generation and longer video preference
Phase 4 completed - Pipeline updated for audio-free operation
