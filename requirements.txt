# Core video processing dependencies
moviepy==1.0.3
opencv-python==4.8.1.78
numpy>=1.24.0
python-dotenv==1.0.0
tqdm==4.66.1
requests==2.31.0

# Gemini API dependency for multimodal video analysis
google-generativeai>=0.8.0

# Audio processing (used by moviepy and for potential future audio analysis)
soundfile>=0.12.0

# Note: The following dependencies have been removed as they are not used by the current working system:
# - openai (not used - system uses Gemini API only)
# - librosa (not used - audio analysis handled by Gemini)
# - cupy-cuda12x (not used - no GPU acceleration currently implemented)
# - torch (not used - no PyTorch models in current system)
# - opencv-contrib-python (not used - basic opencv-python is sufficient)
